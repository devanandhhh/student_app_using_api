## Student Management Application
This is a student management application developed using Flutter with API integration and state management handled by BLoC. It allows users to manage student details through CRUD operations.

# Key Features:
 
* Add Student: Add new students with details like name, roll number, age, department, and phone number.
* CRUD Operations: The app supports the following operations:
* POST: Add new students.
* PATCH: Update student details.
* DELETE: Remove student records.
* GET: Fetch and display student information.
* State Management: The app uses BLoC for efficient state management, ensuring smooth user experience and data handling.
  
This project demonstrates my ability to develop full-stack applications with API integration, CRUD operations, and state management using Flutter.
